## Your Assignment

The District School Board is meeting next month to vote on the proposal to restructure the district. The Board is deciding whether to keep 6th graders at the elementary schools or move them to the Junior High campuses to create 6-8 Middle Schools.

The Board has invited 6th graders to submit essays giving their input. You will write an argumentative essay for the School Board members in which you argue either **for** or **against** moving 6th graders to the Middle School campus.

Make sure you clearly state your claim and write several paragraphs supporting your argument with reasons and details from the sources. Develop your ideas clearly and use your own words, except when quoting directly from the sources. Be sure to give the source title or number for the details or facts you use.

Argumentative Essay Scoring: Your argumentative essay will be scored using the following:

1. **Organization/purpose:** How well did you state and maintain your claim with a logical progression of ideas from beginning to end? How well did your ideas thoughtfully flow from beginning to end using effective transitions? How effective were your introduction and your conclusion?  
2. **Evidence/elaboration:** How well did you integrate relevant and specific information from the sources? How well did you elaborate your ideas? How well did you clearly state ideas in your own words using precise language that is appropriate for your audience and purpose? How well did you reference the sources you used by title or number?  
3. **Conventions:** How well did you follow the rules of grammar usage, punctuation, capitalization, and spelling?

Now begin work on your argumentative essay. Manage your time carefully so that you can:

* plan your multi-paragraph argumentative essay.  
* write your multi-paragraph argumentative essay.  
* revise and edit the final draft of your multi-paragraph argumentative essay.

For Part 2, you are being asked to write a multi-paragraph argumentative essay so please be as thorough as possible. Remember to check your notes and your prewriting/planning as you write and then revise and edit your argumentative essay.

## The Cost of Moving Too Soon

From Education Trends Weekly

For decades, American school districts have debated a difficult question: Where do 6th graders actually belong? Should they be the "Top Dogs"—the oldest and most responsible students in an elementary school? Or should they be the "Bottom Dogs"—the youngest and most inexperienced students in a middle school? While opinions vary, a growing body of research suggests that moving students out of elementary school too early can have serious negative consequences.

### **The "Middle School Plunge"** 

The most famous study on this topic was conducted by researchers Martin West and Guido Schwerdt. They analyzed the test scores of thousands of students to see how transitioning to a new school affected their learning. The results were alarming. The researchers found that when students move from elementary school to middle school, their math and reading achievement drops significantly.

This drop is so common that educators have a name for it: the "Middle School Plunge." The study showed that moving to a middle school caused a drop in student achievement equal to losing 3.5 to 7 months of learning. Essentially, the stress and confusion of the transition caused students to lose half a year of academic progress compared to students who stayed in a K–8 environment.

### **The Identity Crisis** 

Why does this happen? Child psychologists believe the drop occurs because the transition disrupts a student’s sense of belonging at a critical time in their development. Eleven-year-olds are already going through biological and emotional changes. They are trying to figure out who they are.

In a K–6 elementary school, 6th graders are known by their teachers. They have likely been in the same building since kindergarten. They feel safe, seen, and supported. However, when they move to a large, impersonal middle school, they often feel anonymous. "At the very moment when teenagers need support the most, we move them to a massive building where no one knows their name," says Dr. Elena Russo, a child development expert. "They go from being the leaders of the campus to being lost in the crowd. This lack of connection leads to higher anxiety, more behavior problems, and lower grades."

### **The "Top Dog" Benefit** 

Furthermore, there is a confidence boost that comes from being the oldest group on campus. In elementary school, 6th graders are given leadership roles. They act as crossing guards, help in the library, and mentor "reading buddies" in kindergarten. These roles build self-esteem. When these same students are moved to a middle school, those leadership opportunities disappear. Instead of being role models, they are often intimidated by 8th graders who are larger and more mature. Dr. Russo argues that we should protect their childhood for one more year. "There is no rush to grow up," she says. "Let them be children a little while longer."

## Built for Science, Not Snacks

From The Modern Educator Magazine

Nostalgia is a powerful thing. Many parents remember their elementary school days fondly—the colorful rugs, the single classroom, and the recess playground. However, educational experts argue that while elementary schools are warm and nurturing, they are not designed to prepare 6th graders for the rigorous demands of the modern world. We cannot teach 21st-century skills in buildings designed for small children.

### **The Specialist Advantage** 

In a typical elementary classroom, one single teacher is responsible for every subject. They must teach Math, Reading, Writing, Social Studies, and Science to thirty students. While these teachers are dedicated professionals, it is unrealistic to expect one person to be an expert in every single field. In a Middle School model (Grades 6–8), students are taught by subject-matter experts. The math teacher has a degree in mathematics; the history teacher is a historian.

"Our elementary schools don't even have proper science labs," argues Principal Sarah Jenkins, who runs a high-performing Middle School. "Currently, 6th graders are trying to learn chemistry at regular desks with no running water, no gas valves, and no safety equipment. It is just 'book learning.' At the Middle School, we have three fully equipped labs. We can do real experiments. If we want our students to be competitive in STEM fields, they need to be in a building that supports real science."

### **The "Exploratory Wheel"** 

Another major benefit of the Middle School model is the elective system, often called the "Exploratory Wheel." In elementary school, students usually have no choice in what they learn; everyone does the same art project or sings the same song. In Middle School, 6th graders can rotate through a variety of specialized courses. A student might spend nine weeks learning Robotics, then switch to Introduction to Spanish, followed by Digital Art and Woodshop. By exposing students to these subjects earlier, they can discover their passions sooner. A student might find out they love engineering in 6th grade, which helps them choose the right classes when they get to high school.

### **Preparing for Independence** 

Finally, moving to Middle School teaches "executive functioning" skills. In elementary school, students are often guided through every step of their day in single-file lines. In Middle School, they must manage their own time. They have to learn how to use a locker, how to change into gym clothes quickly, and how to navigate a schedule with five different teachers. "We see a huge jump in maturity," says Principal Jenkins. "Yes, the first week is scary. But by October, the students stand taller. They are proud that they are trusted to manage their own day. You can't learn independence if you are never given any freedom."

## The Logistical Reality

From The District Superintendent’s Report on Facilities

| ![](image1.webp) |
| :---- |
| *Two rows of portable classrooms sit across from each other in Solana Vista Elementary in the Solana Beach School District. The classrooms were brought in to solve the increased number of elementary school students.* |

The debate over "what is best for kids" is important, but as a school district, we must also look at "what is possible for our budget." The School Board has reviewed the latest enrollment numbers, and the reality is that our elementary schools are bursting at the seams, while our junior high campuses sit half-empty.

### **The Capacity Crisis** 

Our district’s elementary schools were originally built to hold 500 students each. Currently, due to a housing boom in the area, they average 650 students. At Oak Grove Elementary, the overcrowding has reached a critical level. The situation at Oak Grove is impacting education. The school library has been partitioned into two makeshift classrooms, which means students can no longer visit the library for quiet reading or research. The computer lab has been converted into a storage room.

Worst of all, the district has been forced to rent six "portable" classrooms—trailers that sit on the blacktop—to house the 6th-grade classes. "These portables are a terrible solution," says David Chen, President of the Parent-Teacher Association (PTA). "They are freezing cold in the winter and hot in the summer. They are isolated from the main building, so students lose instruction time just walking to the bathroom. Plus, they take up half the playground, so the kids have nowhere to run during recess."

### **The Financial Waste** 

While the elementary schools are overflowing, the Junior High (Grades 7–8) is under-utilized. Ten years ago, the Junior High housed 1,200 students. Today, because of shifting demographics, it only has 750 students. This means there are entire wings of the Junior High building that sit empty, with the lights turned off. We are paying to heat, cool, and maintain classrooms that no one uses.

### **The Proposed Solution** 

Moving the 6th grade to the Junior High would solve two major problems at once. First, it would immediately relieve the dangerous overcrowding at the elementary schools. Oak Grove could reclaim its library and computer lab, and the younger children would get their playground back. Second, it would save the district a massive amount of money. Renting the portable trailers costs the district $240,000 per year. If we move the students to the empty classrooms at the Junior High, that cost disappears. That is a quarter of a million dollars that could be spent on new books, technology, or teachers, rather than on renting metal trailers.

## By the Numbers

From National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) & District Data

The following data was compiled to help the School Board understand the differences between the two school models. Chart A looks at student behavior records, while Chart B looks at the academic classes available to 6th graders.

### Chart A: *Student Disciplinary Incidents (Per 100 Students) Comparing 6th Graders in Elementary vs. 6th Graders in Middle School*

| **Type of Incident** | **6th Graders in Elementary (K-6)** | **6th Graders in Middle School (6-8)** |
| :---- | ----- | ----- |
| Tardiness (Late to class) | 2% | 14% |
| Classroom Disruption | 5% | 12% |
| Bullying Reports | 3% | 8% |
| **Total Incidents** | **10%** | **34%** |

One of the biggest concerns parents have is student behavior. The data in Chart A tracks the number of disciplinary referrals (when a student is sent to the principal's office) for 6th graders in two different settings.

**Analysis:** *The data indicates that students in Middle School settings are more than three times as likely to face disciplinary action than their peers in Elementary settings. This may be due to the stricter rules in Middle School or the influence of older students.*

### Chart B: *Access to Advanced Courses Percentage of 6th Graders Enrolled in Advanced/Honors Classes*

| **School Type** | **Honors Math** | **Foreign Language** | **Computer Science** |
| :---- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Elementary School (K-6)** | 0% (Not Offered) | 0% (Not Offered) | 5% |
| **Middle School (6-8)** | **22%** | **45%** | **60%** |

While behavior may be better in elementary school, academic access is lower. Chart B shows how many 6th graders are enrolled in "advanced" or specialized coursework depending on which campus they attend.

**Analysis:** *Elementary schools rarely offer Honors Math or World Languages to 6th graders. Students who move to Middle School have significantly higher access to advanced curriculum.*

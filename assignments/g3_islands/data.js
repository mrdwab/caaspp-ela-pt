*The following article includes interesting facts about the cold islands of Greenland and the Faroe Islands.*

## Greenland and the Faroe Islands

An island is a body of land that is not connected to a continent and has water all around it. Islands can be found in oceans, seas, rivers, and lakes. They can be all different sizes. Some islands are only big enough for a few people, while some islands are huge. Some islands are hot all year around and other islands are cold.

Greenland and the Faroe Islands are a group of cold islands. They are rocky, covered in ice, and they do not have trees, but they are very pretty. Glaciers circle the islands, and ice bergs float by in the summer. Because Greenland and the Faroe Islands are wet, lots of things grow there. There are over 1,000 kinds of plants that bring many birds to the islands.

The people in Greenland and the Faroe Islands live in brightly colored houses that dot the hillsides. They share the land with many animals. Seals, walruses, and polar bears live there. There are a few roads that connect the towns, but people mainly use dog sleds to get around.

The people of Greenland and the Faroe Islands depend on fishing. They cannot farm the cold, hard land, but they can fish!

The people of Greenland and the Faroe Islands do many things for fun. Even though it may be cold on these islands, the people there camp in tents, go bird watching, fish in the sea, and hike the island mountains. While they have modern forms of amusement like television and the Internet, they also have kept their old traditions like poetry, music, drama and storytelling. One special tradition is the chain dance. This dance has been passed down for hundreds of years. People do the chain dance at festivals and other events. They even join chain dance clubs!

As you can see, the people of Greenland and the Faroe Islands have a rich and interesting island life. You would have fun on a visit to their cold islands.

*The following article includes interesting facts about tropical islands.*

## Exploring Tropical Islands

by Sarah Donovan Chase

![](image1.jpg)

There are more than 45,000 tropical islands in the world. A tropical island is one that is hot and wet most of the time. These islands are found near the equator, where it is warmest all year. Because of that, tropical islands do not get cold.

Tropical islands get a lot of sun all year and have a long rainy season. They have thick forests and interesting plant life. During hurricane season, tropical islands often experience very high winds. The people who live on these islands build homes that can hold up to strong winds.

Tropical islands have many types of vines, bushes, and small flowering plants. There are also more than 2,600 types of palm trees found on these islands. Fruit trees also grow there. If you visited one of these islands, you could eat a coconut or banana right off the tree.

Some tropical islands, like the Florida Keys, are very flat. Some have mountains and hills, and others have a mix of high and low spots. Most of them have sandy beaches. Many tropical islands have huge waterfalls and coral reefs. All of them have lagoons, or shallow pools sheltered from the ocean by sandbars.

Because the islands have water all around them, there is a lot of sea life. Sharks, eels, crabs, and many kinds of colorful fish live in the waters. There are also a lot of insects, like big spiders. You might find lizards, peacocks, snakes, and maybe even a chimpanzee in the back yard!

When people visit a tropical island they can swim in the ocean, play in the sand, sail boats, hike trails, and fish in the ocean. Each hot island has its own traditions and things that make it special. If you visit a tropical island you will find many things to do, and you will certainly have a good time!

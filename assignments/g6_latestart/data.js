You will now review your sources, take notes, and plan, draft, revise, and edit your writing. You may use your notes and go back to the sources. 

## Your Assignment

The School Board is meeting next month to vote on the start time. You will write an essay arguing either **for** or **against** moving the start time to 8:45 AM. Make sure you clearly state your claim and write several paragraphs supporting your argument with reasons and details from the sources. Develop your ideas clearly and use your own words, except when quoting directly from the sources. Be sure to give the source title or number for the details or facts you use.

Argumentative Essay Scoring:

Your argumentative essay will be scored using the following:

1. **Organization/purpose:** How well did you state and maintain your claim with a logical progression of ideas from beginning to end? How well did your ideas thoughtfully flow from beginning to end using effective transitions? How effective were your introduction and your conclusion?  
2. **Evidence/elaboration:** How well did you integrate relevant and specific information from the sources? How well did you elaborate your ideas? How well did you clearly state ideas in your own words using precise language that is appropriate for your audience and purpose? How well did you reference the sources you used by title or number?  
3. **Conventions:** How well did you follow the rules of grammar usage, punctuation, capitalization, and spelling?

Now begin work on your argumentative essay. Manage your time carefully so that you can

* plan your multi-paragraph argumentative essay.  
* write your multi-paragraph argumentative essay.  
* revise and edit the final draft of your multi-paragraph argumentative essay.

For Part 2, you are being asked to write a multi-paragraph argumentative essay so please be as thorough as possible. Remember to check your notes and your prewriting/planning as you write and then revise and edit your argumentative essay.

There is a debate in a neighboring school district about changing the start time for middle and high schools. Currently, schools in this district start at 7:30 AM. The School Board is considering moving the start time to 8:45 AM.

To help the School Board decide, you have been asked to write an essay arguing for or against this change. You have three sources to review:

* Source 1 explains the science of teenage sleep.  
* Source 2 explains the costs and schedule problems of starting later.  
* Source 3 is a news article about a district that already made the change.

In Part 2, you will write an argument essay using the information you’ve read.

## Directions for Beginning

You will now look at three sources. You can look at the sources as often as you like.

## Research Questions

After looking at the sources, use the rest of the time in Part 1 to answer question(s) about them. Your answers will be scored. Also, your answers will help you think about the information you have read and looked at, which should help you write.

You may look at your notes when you think it would be helpful. Answer the questions in the spaces below them.

## The Science of Sleepy Students

From Health and Science Today

Beep\! Beep\! Beep\! The alarm goes off at 6:00 AM. For many students, climbing out of bed feels like climbing a mountain. According to doctors, this isn't just because students stay up late playing video games. It is a biological fact.

### **The Internal Clock** 

Every human has an internal "body clock" called a circadian rhythm. This tells us when to wake up and when to sleep. When children enter puberty (around age 10 to 12), this clock shifts. Their bodies start producing melatonin—the hormone that makes you sleepy—much later at night.

For an adult, 10:00 PM feels like bedtime. But for a teenager, 10:00 PM feels like the middle of the afternoon. Their bodies often do not feel tired until 11:00 PM or midnight. When schools start at 7:30 AM, these students are forced to wake up before their bodies are ready. This state is often called "social jet lag."

### **Sleep and Success** 

A tired brain struggles to learn. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that middle and high schools start no earlier than 8:30 AM. Studies show that when students get an extra hour of sleep, their grades improve.

| **Hours of Sleep per Night** | **Math Score Average (out of 100\)** | **Reading Score Average (out of 100\)** |
| :---- | ----- | ----- |
| Less than 7 hours | 72 | 74 |
| 7 to 8 hours | 81 | 83 |
| **8 to 9 hours (Recommended)** | **89** | **91** |
| More than 9 hours | 92 | 93 |

## It’s Not Just About the Alarm Clock

From The District Superintendent’s Weekly Newsletter

We all want students to be well-rested. However, shifting the school start time from 7:30 AM to 8:45 AM creates a "domino effect" of problems that hurts families and costs the district money.

### **The Bus Problem** 

Our district uses the same buses for high school, middle school, and elementary school. The buses take the older students first, drop them off, and then loop back to pick up the elementary students. If we push the middle school time back to 8:45 AM, we would need to buy twice as many buses to get everyone to school at the same time. Each bus costs over $100,000. That is money we would have to take away from buying books or hiring teachers.

### **The Parent Problem** 

Most parents work jobs that start at 8:00 AM or 9:00 AM. If school doesn't start until 8:45 AM, parents cannot drop their children off before work. This leaves many students home alone in the morning.

### **Community Feedback**

Last month, the district sent a survey to 2,000 parents to ask their opinion on the schedule change. The results show that the community is worried. Over 60% of parents voted "No" to the time change.

"I want my son to get more sleep, but I also need to keep my job," said David Miller, a father of two middle school students. "If the bus doesn't pick him up until 8:15 AM, I will be late for work every single day. I don't know how we would make it work."

### **The Sports Problem** 

If school starts later, it also ends later. Currently, students get out at 2:30 PM. This leaves plenty of time for sports practice before the sun goes down. If school ends at 4:00 PM during the winter, it will be dark before practice even starts. This would mean schools need to install expensive stadium lights for baseball, soccer, and football fields.

## One District’s Experiment

From The Oak Creek Gazette

Two years ago, the Oak Creek School District voted to move their start time to 9:00 AM. Now that the experiment has been running for a while, the community is divided on the results.

### **Happy Students, Happy Teachers** 

Principal Maria Gonzalez says the change has been wonderful inside the classroom. "In the old days, first-period classes were like a graveyard. Students had their heads on their desks," she said. "Now, they are awake and participating. Attendance has gone up, and fights have gone down."

Teachers have noticed the difference, too. Mr. Henderson, who teaches 7th-grade math, used to struggle to get students to focus during his morning classes. "I used to spend the first twenty minutes of class just trying to wake them up," Henderson explained. "Now, when the bell rings at 9:00 AM, they have their books open and they are actually asking questions. It feels like a completely different school."

Eighth-grader Toby Smith agrees. "I used to be late to school twice a week," Toby said. "Now, I actually eat breakfast. I feel like a human being in the morning."

### **After-School Struggles** 

However, the afternoons have become chaotic. Because school gets out so late, the town’s traffic patterns have changed. Parents rushing home from work get stuck behind school buses that are dropping kids off at 4:30 PM. The traffic jams on Main Street have doubled since the schedule change.

Furthermore, student-athletes are exhausted. Sarah Jenkins, a soccer player, says her schedule is harder now than it was before. "We don't finish practice until almost 6:30 PM because we have to wait for field space," she said. "By the time I get home, shower, and eat dinner, it’s 8:00 PM. I don't even start my homework until it's pitch black outside. I'm actually staying up later now than I did before just to get everything done."

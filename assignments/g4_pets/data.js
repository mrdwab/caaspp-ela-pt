You will now review your sources, take notes, and plan, draft, revise, and edit your writing. You may use your notes and go back to the sources. Now read your assignment and the information about how your writing will be scored; then begin your work.

### Your Assignment

Your class teacher has agreed to adopt a classroom pet. Your teacher has narrowed down the choices of animals to a guinea pig or a bearded dragon. 

You will write an opinion essay in which you give your opinion on which type of pet would be better for your classroom. Make sure you clearly state your opinion and write several paragraphs supporting your opinion with reasons and details from the sources. Develop your ideas clearly and use your own words, except when quoting directly from the sources. Be sure to give the source title or number for the details or facts you use.

REMEMBER: A well-written opinion essay:

* has a clear opinion  
* is well-organized and stays on the topic  
* has an introduction and conclusion  
* uses transitions   
* uses details or facts from the sources to support your opinion  
* puts the information from the sources in your own words, except when using direct quotations from the sources  
* gives the title or number of the source for the details or facts you included  
* develops ideas clearly  
* uses clear language  
* follows rules of writing (spelling, punctuation, and grammar)

Now begin work on your opinion essay. Manage your time carefully so that you can:

1. plan your opinion essay  
2. write your opinion essay  
3. revise and edit the final draft of your opinion essay

Your class is thinking about getting a classroom pet. You and your classmates have been learning about different animals that are kept as pets. You want to learn more and decide to do more research on what animals make the best classroom pets. You have found two articles about classroom pets.

After you have looked at these sources, you will answer some questions about them. Briefly scan the sources and the questions that follow. Then, go back and read the sources carefully so you will have the information you will need to answer the questions and complete your research.

In Part 2, you will write an opinion essay using information you have read.

## Directions for Beginning

You will now look at three sources. You can look at the sources as often as you like.

## Research Questions

After looking at the sources, use the rest of the time in Part 1 to answer question(s) about them. Your answers will be scored. Also, your answers will help you think about the information you have read and looked at, which should help you write.

You may look at your notes when you think it would be helpful. Answer the questions in the spaces below them.

## Thinking Before You Adopt

From School & Community Weekly

Walking into a classroom and seeing a friendly animal is a highlight for many students. Pets can teach empathy, which is the ability to understand how others feel. They also teach responsibility. However, experts warn that teachers and students must consider three main factors before bringing an animal into the school: space, safety, and cost.

#### **Space and Environment** 

A classroom is a busy, noisy place. Some animals, like rabbits, are easily frightened by loud noises and need a quiet environment. Others, like hamsters, are nocturnal, meaning they want to sleep while students are learning math. The best classroom pets are those that are awake during the day and have a temperament, or personality, that can handle activity.

#### **Safety and Health** 

Safety is the most important factor. Teachers must check if any students have allergies to fur or dander. If a student is allergic, a furry animal might make them sneeze or feel sick. Additionally, students must learn proper hygiene. They must wash their hands after handling any animal to stop the spread of germs.

#### **The Cost of Care** 

Finally, keeping a pet is not free. Teachers need to think about the budget. Buying the animal is just the start. There are ongoing costs like food, bedding, and cleaning supplies. Also, if the pet gets sick, a trip to the veterinarian can be very expensive. Often, schools do not provide money for pets, so teachers have to pay for these supplies with their own money.

#### **Popularity** 

Despite the work involved, many schools choose to adopt pets. The table below, from a survey of 500 teachers, shows which animals are currently the most common in elementary schools.

*What Teachers Are Choosing*

| **Rank** | **Animal** | **Percentage of Teachers** | **Fun Fact** |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | **Freshwater Fish** | 31% | Watching fish swim can improve focus. |
| 2 | **Guinea Pig** | 14% | They have teeth that never stop growing. |
| 3 | **Hamster** | 11% | They can run up to 5 miles a night on a wheel. |
| 4 | **Bearded Dragon** | 9% | They can change the color of their "beard" (neck). |
| 5 | **Rabbit** | 5% | Their big ears help keep them cool. |

*Every year, the National Teacher Association asks elementary school teachers about the animals in their classrooms. This table shows the top 5 animals chosen by teachers this year.*

## The Social Science of Guinea Pigs

From Nature for Kids Magazine

Guinea pigs, also known as cavies, are rodents native to South America. Unlike hamsters or gerbils, guinea pigs are herd animals. In the wild, they live in large groups for safety. Because of this, they are extremely social creatures. A guinea pig kept alone can become depressed. Therefore, experts recommend that classrooms adopt a pair of guinea pigs so they have companionship.

#### **Communication** 

One reason guinea pigs are popular in fourth grade is their ability to communicate. They make a variety of sounds. They "purr" when they are content and make a loud whistling sound, called a "wheek," when they are excited or hungry. This responsiveness helps students feel a connection to the animal.

#### **Requirements and Care** 

While they are friendly, guinea pigs require significant maintenance. Because they are larger than other rodents, they require a cage that is at least 7.5 square feet. This takes up a large amount of table or floor space.

Their diet consists of hay, pellets, and fresh vegetables. Vitamin C is crucial for their health, so students often bring in bell peppers or oranges as treats. However, because they eat frequently, their cages must be cleaned daily to prevent odors. Furthermore, guinea pigs are chewers. Teachers must be careful to keep electrical cords away from the cage, or the animals might chew through them during play time.

## A Dragon in the Room

From Reptile Life Today

For classrooms that want to study biology up close, the Bearded Dragon is a fascinating choice. These lizards, originally from the deserts of Australia, look like miniature dinosaurs. They have a "beard" of scales under their chin that they can puff out if they feel threatened, though they rarely do this to humans.

#### **A Hypoallergenic Option** 

One of the strongest arguments for choosing a Bearded Dragon is that they are hypoallergenic. Unlike guinea pigs, they have scales instead of fur. They do not produce the dander that causes allergic reactions in many children. This allows all students to participate in caring for the pet.

#### **Specific Environmental Needs** 

Bearded Dragons are ectotherms, which means they are cold-blooded. They rely on their environment to control their body temperature. A classroom tank must have a "basking spot" with a heat lamp that reaches roughly 100 degrees Fahrenheit, and a cooler side for the lizard to rest. If the heat lamp breaks, the lizard cannot digest its food properly and can become ill.

#### **Diet and Hygiene** 

Feeding a Bearded Dragon can be an exciting science lesson. They are omnivores, meaning they eat both plants and meat. Students can feed them leafy greens, but the lizard also needs to hunt live insects, such as crickets or dubia roaches. While this is educational, some students find the bugs unpleasant. Additionally, all reptiles can carry salmonella bacteria. Students must be very disciplined about washing their hands immediately after touching the lizard to avoid getting sick.

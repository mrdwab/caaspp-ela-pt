*This article was originally published on April 19, 1906, in a combined copy of the San Francisco Call, Examiner and Chronicle. The 1906 San Francisco earthquake struck Northern California on April 18\. Huge fires broke out in the city, lasting for several days. As a result, about 3,000 people died. Most of San Francisco was destroyed. To deal with the situation, federal troops were sent to patrol the city. However, the article is incorrect in stating that San Francisco was placed under military rule.*

## **Time Machine (1906): Earthquake and fire**  **leave San Francisco in ruins**

Death and ruin have struck San Francisco. The city was shaken by an earthquake at 5:13 yesterday morning, with a shock lasting 48 seconds. Flames raged in all directions, leaving the city a mass of smoking ruins. At 6 o'clock last evening, the flames appeared to move more powerfully. They spread out, threatening to destroy the areas they had spared earlier in the day.

Leaving the devastated business section, the flames skipped in a dozen directions to the neighborhoods where people live. As night fell, they made their way over into the North Beach section. Turning south, they reached out along the shipping section down the bay shore. From there, they spread over the hills and across toward Third and Townsend streets.

Warehouses, shops and factories fell in their path. The flames completed the ruin of the area known as the "South of Market Street." How far the flames are reaching to the south cannot be known. That part of the city is shut off from San Francisco papers.

### **Everything In Ruins**

After darkness, thousands of the homeless were making their way to Golden Gate Park and the beach for shelter. Those in the homes on the hills piled their belongings in the streets. Express wagons and automobiles were hauling the things away to areas with few people. Everybody in San Francisco is prepared to leave the city. They believe San Francisco will be totally destroyed.

Downtown, everything is in ruin. Not a business stands. Theaters are crumbled into heaps. Factories and other business buildings lie smoking where they used to stand.

All of the newspaper offices have been rendered useless. The Call and the Examiner buildings, except for the Call's newsrooms on Stevenson Street, were entirely destroyed.

### **Millions Of Dollars In Losses**

It is estimated that the loss in San Francisco will reach from $150 million to $200 million. These figures are not official, and nothing can be told until some accounting is undertaken.

On every side, there was death and suffering yesterday. Hundreds were injured, either burned, crushed or struck by falling pieces from the buildings. One person died on the operating table at Mechanics' Pavilion. This building was used as a hospital for the injured.

The number of dead is not yet known. It is estimated that at least 500 were killed in the horror.

At 9 o'clock, President Theodore Roosevelt placed the city under military rule. Hundreds of troops patrolled the streets and held back the crowds. Others were sent to help the fire and police departments. The strictest orders were issued, and in true military spirit, the soldiers obeyed. All the crowds were forced from the level district to the hilly section beyond to the north.

### **Brave Workers Try To Help**

The water supply was entirely cut off. It may be it was just as well, for the fire departments' hoses would have been useless. Officer John Dougherty looked after the work of his men. Early in the morning, it was seen that the only way to save the city was to stop the flames by using dynamite. 

During the day, blasts could be heard every few minutes, and buildings not destroyed by fire were blown to pieces. This created an empty area around the fire where the flames could not pass. Sometimes, however, the flames jumped through the gaps. Although the brave efforts of the police, firemen and soldiers sometimes failed, they continued to fight. Men worked very hard to stop the laughing, roaring fire monster.

## **What will really happen when San Andreas**  **unleashes the "Big One"?**

Imagine this: A giant earthquake strikes California. Skyscrapers topple. The Hoover Dam crumbles. A massive tsunami washes across the Golden Gate Bridge.

This scenario played out on the big screen in 2015\. It was the driving action of the movie "San Andreas."

The moviemakers spoke to Thomas Jordan, director of the Southern California Earthquake Center, before they started filming. However, Jordan says, "they probably didn't take much of my advice."

### **Expecting The Big One**

California has long been expecting an earthquake of magnitude 8 or greater. It is referred to as the Big One. The threat of the Big One is pretty terrifying, but its effects would be nowhere near as bad as the devastation shown in the film.

For example, even the largest possible quake in southern California would not produce a massive tidal wave like the one that hits San Francisco in the movie. Jordan explains that big tsunamis are caused by major earthquakes that move the seafloor. The San Andreas fault, however, sits far inland.

The San Andreas is the most worrisome of California's faults. A fault is a fracture in the Earth's crust. Movement big and small can occur at fault lines. 

The movie may be more fantasy than reality. The Big One really is coming, though. When it hits, it will cause plenty of damage.

California sits at the border between two major tectonic plates. One is the Pacific plate, which is moving northwest. The other is the North American plate, which is sliding past it to the southeast. The two plates do not just meet at a single line — the state is actually crisscrossed with dozens of earthquake faults.

On average, Southern California has seen big quakes every 110 to 140 years. The last really big quake near Los Angeles struck Fort Tejon in 1857\. It was a magnitude 7.9 earthquake. Farther south, near Palm Springs, the fault hasn't ruptured in over 300 years.

"Eventually the fault will have to break," Jordan says.

### **The Big One Forecasting**

Seismologists can't predict exactly when that will happen. Every few years, though, they predict the likelihood of such an event. The U.S. Geological Survey published one of these forecasts in 2015\. It estimates a 7 percent chance that a magnitude 8 quake will hit California within the next 30 years. The biggest earthquake magnitude ever recorded was 9.5. This quake hit southern Chile in 1960\.

Several years ago, a team of earthquake experts tried to figure out what could really happen when the Big One finally strikes California. They created something called the ShakeOut scenario. Seismologists modeled how the ground would shake during a major quake. Then other experts used that information to estimate the resulting damage. The detailed report examines the effects of a hypothetical 7.8 magnitude quake.

Here's what it might look like: In the minutes after the quake hits, earthquake waves travel across California. They level older buildings and disrupt roads. They cut electric, telephone and water lines. These lines won't be repaired for months.

Hundreds of fires start. With roads blocked and the water system damaged, emergency workers aren't be able to put all of the fires out. Smaller fires merge into larger ones. Whole sections of Los Angeles burn.

### **Long-Term Devastation**

The report's team was surprised by the extent of the fire damage from the quake, notes Lucy Jones. She is a seismologist with the USGS. She was part of the team of scientists who worked on the ShakeOut predictions.

Overall, scientists said, the Big One could cause about $200 billion in damage. It could lead to 50,000 injuries and 2,000 deaths.

Jones points out that destruction, injury and death are just the short-term impacts of the quake. There would also be devastating long-term effects. Everything a city relies on to function — water, electricity, sewage systems, roads — would be damaged. It would take at least a year to repair these systems. Without them, the local economy would struggle. Many people would leave Los Angeles altogether.

### **What Is There To Do?**

The effects of the Big One sound so drastic that Californians may think there is nothing to be done about it. Why bother to prepare? 

Jones is fighting this idea. She has worked with the Los Angeles mayor's office to help the city prepare for a big quake. Her team has suggested changing building codes to require that older structures are updated. Updates could keep these structures from collapsing in the quake. The Los Angeles aqueduct, which carries water to the city, could be strengthened so that it doesn't break. Backup systems for power and Internet could be put in place.

The preparation plan is not simple. It would take billions of dollars and several decades of work. But it may be necessary to improve the city's ability to survive an earthquake catastrophe.
